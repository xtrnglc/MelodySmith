querying registry for location of DEFAULT jvm.dll
* WARNING: Could not find jvm.dll location in registry! 
 using the one from the PATH environment variable!
**ERROR: Could not locate jvm.dll. 
			It seems that you dont have a properly installed Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
			If so, please download (its free!) and install one from 

			http://www.java.com/ 

			If you already did that and see this message again, please add the path 
			where the jvm.dll is located to your PATH environment variable.

			Per default, the jvm.dll is located in 'C:\j2sdk1.4.2_05\jre\bin\client'. But this 
			may differ depending on your choice during installation. 
			You can modify your PATH variable if you click 

			Start/Settings/Control Panel/System/Advanced (Tab)/Environment Variables (Button)
			/System Variables (the textbox at the bottom).
			Double-click on the variable called Path, and add a ';the-path-where-jvm.dll-is-located' 
			to the end of its value.
			Note the ';' at the beginning of the string. close all windows with ok, and you 
			should be all set.
			If you still cant use the plugin, contact the forum at
